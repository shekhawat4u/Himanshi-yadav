        Hey Himanshi ❤️, <br /><br />
        Even though we haven't met in person yet, it feels like we've known each other forever. 
        Every chat we have just makes me feel closer to you. 😌
        I can’t explain it, but there’s this vibe between us that’s so special. 
        I’m so happy that we got to know each other, and I can’t wait till the day we actually meet face-to-face. 😍
        Until then, I’m just here, thinking about you and looking forward to all the moments we’ll share in the future. 
        You’re truly amazing, and I feel lucky to have you in my life. 💫

        <br /><br />
        Always yours, <br /> Shekhawat 💖
      </p>
